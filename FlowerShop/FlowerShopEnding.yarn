/// From Josh: Let me know if this isn't the best way of organizing this final node, I'm happy to split this into more nodes if it's better for Dev!
Do you need help cleaning it up?
-> No, you enjoy your date.
    Thank you, I'm sure Hana will love these flowers!
-> I wouldn't ask that of you
    Are you sure? I don't mind.
    -> There's a group coming by tonight, don't worry.
        Alright, well I hope your day gets better.
