{$customerName}: Well I- I don't actually know... We just started dating last week and I... Should I have asked?
{$customerName}: I figured couples usually get flowers so I wanted to get her flowers...
{$customerName}: Is there some kind of flower people usually get?
<<darken>>
{$floristName}: Well, if you're looking for flowers for a first partner, my husband got me roses on our first date, and that turned out well! 
{$floristName}: You could also choose peonies, but they're quite popular at weddings and that might lead to... questions.
{$floristName}: Daisies represent youth, which is perfect for a young love. 
{$floristName}: But of course, it's your choice, you know her best.
