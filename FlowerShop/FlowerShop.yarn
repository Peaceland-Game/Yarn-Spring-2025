Well I... I don't actually know... Should I have asked? I just wanted to get her flowers because we, like, just got together and I figured couples usually get flowers so I wanted flowers, is some kind of flower people usually get?
-> Well, if you're looking for flowers for a first partner, my husband got these for me on our first date, and that turned out well! You could choose these ones, but they're quite popular at weddings, and that might lead to... questions. These ones represent youth, which is perfect for a young love. But of course, it's your choice, you know her best.
