I'm glad to hear that. Let me know if there's anything you want to talk about.

I'm buying you flowers. Make a nice bouquet for yourself, go all out, and enjoy it. For me.

    <<jump DontHaveTime>>
-> I can't let you do that
    <<jump CantLetYou>>

Surely you can do it at the end of your shift, right? 
It doesn't need to be fancy, as long as it's for you.
-> ...thank you.
    <<jump Alright>>
-> Alright, I'll get around to it later.
    <<jump Alright>>

title: CantLetYou

Well too bad, I'm doing it.
It's either you make it for yourself, or you make it for me and I give it to you later.
Either way, you're getting flowers.
-> There's no winning, is there?
    <<jump Alright>>
-> Fine, fine. I'll get to it at the end of my shift.

You don't need to say anything. Just let me pay you and accept the order.
-> Alright, fine
    <<jump Alright>>

title: Alright

Great! Have fun with it, I'd imagine you need something like that right now.
